# Solana Airdrop

**Solana Airdrop** is a simple TypeScript-based project to generate a new wallet and request airdrops on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). This project serves as a starting point for developers who want to work with Solana wallets and explore its ecosystem.

## Features

- **Generate Wallets**: Create new Solana wallets programmatically.
- **Request Airdrops**: Request test SOL tokens from the Solana devnet for experimentation.
- **TypeScript-Based**: Built entirely with TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Yarn** (or npm)
- **Solana CLI** (optional, for additional Solana network management)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenrikut/solana-airdrop.git
   cd solana-airdrop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the script to generate a wallet and request airdrop:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. (Optional) Test the script:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## How It Works

This project provides the following key functionality:

1. **Generate a Wallet**: The script generates a new keypair for a Solana wallet.
2. **Request Airdrop**: The script requests test SOL tokens from the Solana devnet to fund the new wallet.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the main TypeScript files for wallet generation and airdrop functionality.
- **/tests**: Includes test cases to verify the script's functionality.
- **/scripts**: Automation scripts for repetitive tasks.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of what the output looks like when you run the script:

```bash
Generated new wallet:
Public Key: 4xj7...yX3p
Private Key: [hidden for security]

Requested airdrop of 2 SOL to the wallet:
Transaction ID: 4bHf...7jXq
```

## Scripts

- **`yarn start`**: Run the wallet generation and airdrop script.
- **`yarn test`**: Run the test suite.
- **`yarn build`**: Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
